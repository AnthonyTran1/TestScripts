# TestScripts

This Repository will explain what I did for each Python Exercise Task<br/>

## Exercise 1.1

### Main Topics

- Intialized Virtual Python Environment for this course called "cf-python-base"
- created first python programs: hello.py and a simple adding app add.py

### Installations

- Python
- virtualenvwrapper

## Exercise 1.2

### Main Topics

- Learned about different data types of Python such as int, floats, bool.
- Learned about different data structures such as Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries.
- Learned about different operations using variables.

### Installations

- None

### Steps

- Step 1: Created recipe_1 using a dictionary structure due to have different components being listed out such as<br>
  strings for name, ints for time and lists for ingredients. Using these structure allows me to access each individual item <br>
  using a key and value pairing for ease of access.
- Step 2: Created an outer structure called all_recipes using a list structure because this structure will just house <br>
  all the new recipes, making it a list of dictionaries. If i had to find a recipe, I would first check each recipe by index <br>
  and then check the key "Name" to find what I'm looking for.
